# Discord Bot
This is a project I'm using to learn how to create a discord bot. I may change features and functionality often. In its current state, the bot will send a message and an emoji to the chat, then react to the message that called it.

## How It's Made

**Tech Used:** Python

I'm using this as an opportunity to use python, as the script for the bot is written using [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

## Optimizations
I expect to update and refactor this frequently as my proficiency in Python improves, and my goals become clearer.

## Lessons Learned:

So far, I'm getting to know Async in Python, as well as how the Discord api works.
